#Does not setup everything. Still need to: setup servo-mixing, calibrate voltage+current sensors, and must calibrate ESC

# feature
feature MOTOR_STOP        # Prevents motor from spinning while armed
feature GPS               # Enables GPS
feature DASHBOARD         # 
feature PWM_OUTPUT_ENABLE # PWM is used for servos

# aux, this sets up channels in the modes tab. This should stay consistent between all wings,
# so that once a transmitter is setup it can be easily used for any wing
